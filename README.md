## About the Project

macOS features a brilliant idea for the way to switch your keyboard's input source—the Globe key. While the idea is
brilliant in design, in practice, however, the key is coded in a very intrusive and impractical way, which might
prevent some users—especially those who tend to switch their input source often—from enjoying their overall user
experience.

This utility completely reworks the way the Globe key functions and provides users with an improved overall user
experience, and I sincerely hope that one day Apple is going to make it this way out-of-box.

## Getting Started

The utility replaces the default behavior of the Globe key and adds two new modes to it:

1. **Single Press Mode**

   Single press mode is the mode that is activated when the Globe key is pressed once.

   Single press mode cycles between your primary input sources—I believe most of the users out there will not even need
   the other available mode as it is probably only useful if you have more than average amount of input sources.

   Single press mode uses the input sources defined in the config's `input_sources.primary` array.

2. **Double Press Mode**

   Double press mode is the mode that is activated when the Globe key is double pressed.

   Double press mode cycles between your additional input sources. If you use multiple input sources, you
   probably use only several input sources frequently—you might consider putting those that you use the least under
   additional input sources.

   Double press mode uses the input sources defined in the config's `input_sources.additional` array.

   Double press maximum delay is also configurable in the config's `double_press.maximum_delay` property.

   > **N.B.** This is not working as designed at the moment—this is supposed to open the original input source popup, but
   > implementing it requires some reverse engineering. There is probably a function in macOS private API that can be used
   > to open the popup.

### Prerequisites

- A macOS-powered computer
- A keyboard that features the Globe key, e.g. MacBook's builtin keyboard
- A will to use this utility and some effort

### Setting It Up

- Install the utility via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

  ```bash
  brew tap Serpentiel/betterglobekey https://github.com/Serpentiel/betterglobekey.git
  brew install betterglobekey
  ```

- Start the service:

  ```bash
  brew services start betterglobekey
  ```

> **P.S.** The utility's config file has been automatically generated for you at `~/.betterglobekey.yaml`.
> Do not forget to disable the default Globe key behavior under _System Preferences > Keyboard_.
